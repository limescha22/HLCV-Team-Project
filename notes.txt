Higher level computer Vision methods

1. Identify which images may irritate the model (later we can train with and without these images to test which performs better)
2. Data augmentation (design in a function-calling manner so that we can experiment with different set ups)
3. Model creation (experiment with different architectures and parameters)
4. Evaluate which types of pictures are detected well and which are not.
